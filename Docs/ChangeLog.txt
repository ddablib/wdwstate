; Change Log for Window State Components
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v5.6.0 of 12 January 2014
+ Added new RootKeyEx property to TPJRegWdwState that acts as an alias for the existing RootKey property with the difference that it exposes friendly names for supported registry hives. This make setting the registry root key in Delphi's object inspector more intuitive.
+ Added new OnGetRegDataEx that enables the registry root key to be set using same symbols used by the RootKeyEx property. The event takes precedence over the older OnGetRegData event that operates directly on HKEY values.
+ Changed demo 1 (StandardDemo) to demonstrate how to handle the new OnGetRegDataEx event instead of OnGetRegData. Revised and corrected the instructions that appear in the demo's main window and dialogue box.
+ Updated documentation re the changes.
+ Fixed some errors in change log.

Release v5.5.3 of 11 January 2014
+ Fixed problem with compiler directives in Window State Components unit that was causing compilation to fail on Delphi XE5.
+ Minor documentation tweaks and corrections.

Release v5.5.2 of 30 October 2013
+ Fixed registry access code in TPJRegWdwState to use 64 bit registry view when running on 64 bit Windows. Note that this fix doesn't work when compiled with Delphi 5 and earlier.
+ Updated font in the "StandardDemo" demo program to conform to other demo forms.
+ Updated documentation.

Release v5.5.1 of 07 June 2013
+ Fixed issue 27: "Window State Components release 5.5.0 does not compile on Delphi XE2 or later" (http://code.google.com/p/ddab-lib/issues/detail?id=27).

Release v5.5.0 of 06 June 2013
+ Changed how TPJWdwState determines the name of the ini file it uses to store window state data.
  - Introduced new IniRootDir property that specifies whether relative ini file names are to be relative to %appdata%, %programdata%, windows directory or program executable file directory. Fixes issue #15 (http://bit.ly/ZQ1OPc).
  - Default behaviour changed to use %appdata% instead of windows directory for relative ini files.
  - Added new OnGetIniDataEx event to permit IniRootDir property value to be overridden.
  - Behaviour of OnGetIniData has been changed to add default folders to relative file names set in the event handler.
  - Added new IniFilePath method to return the fully specified name of the ini file.
+ If ini file directories do not exist they are now created instead of causing errors.
+ Any empty section names set in TPJWdwState.OnGetIniData event handlers are now replaced with a default section name.
+ Updated demos:
  - Modified demo #2 to demonstrate TPJWdwState's use of the IniRootDir and IniFilePath properties and to write that window state ini file to %appdata%.
  - Fixed demo #4 to preserve its pre-v5.5 behaviour of writing the ini file to the program's executable directory.
+ Tidied up some code.
+ Revised documentation (help file not updated - it is now deprecated).
+ Renamed link to online documentation and changed the URL.

Release v5.4.2 of 24 April 2013
+ Fixed bug #26 (http://code.google.com/p/ddab-lib/issues/detail?id=26) where the window position was not restored correctly for main windows that touched or overlapped the task-bar when it was located at the top or left of the screen.

  - Enabled components to work with MDI child forms.

Release v5.0 of 15 October 2006
+ Added new TPJUserWdwState component that gets user to provide implementation of reading and writing persistent storage by handling events.
+ Changed TPJCustomWdwState.OnReadWdwState to protected and exposed in TPJWdwState and TPJRegWdwState. This is not used in TPJUserWdwState.
+ Updated help files re new TPJUserWdwState component.

Release v4.0 of 17 March 2002
+ Made use ParamStr(0) for default name of ini file and registry key.
+ Changed name of default registry sub key and ini file section to enable use of multiple forms without overwriting each other's data when using default property values.
+ Rewrote method of auto saving and restoring windows to stop having to manipulate the owning form's OnCreate and OnDestroy event handlers. Now uses a hook class to hook into owning form's messages and pass them to window state components. The window now always momentarily appears in normal state before being maximized or minimized as required.
+ Added new MinimizeDelay property to control how long the normal window appears before being minimized.
+ Added OnGetIniData event to TPJWdwState and OnGetRegData events to TPJRegWdwState to allow user to override property values for reading / writing ini file and registry.

+ Added AutoSaveRestore property to enable forms to be automatically saved and restored. (Thanks to Stefan Winter for suggesting this and providing prototype code).
+ Modified window restoration code to avoid task bars in positions other than bottom of screen. (Again thanks to Stefan for pointing out the problem and providing prototype code to fix it).
+ Prevented forms being restored as minimized from flashing on screen (by cheating!)
+ Removed conditional compilation statements since this version will not compile under Delphi 1.

Release v2.1 of 29 November 1999
